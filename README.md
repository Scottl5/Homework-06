# Homework-06

This week's homework required us to make a weather website using the OpenWeather API. In the HTML, I created an input box and a button that was displayed on the screen called search. Underneath the input box and button, I created an empty div that would display information based off of click functions. To the right of the search bar, I created another hidden div that would display the current forecast and the five day forecast that would appear once the search button was clicked. In Javascript, I created several functions. The first function was called when the search button was clicked. This function allows the user to correctly call the API as you needed a city name in the url. The city name was defined to the value of the search bar. Within that function, two other functions were called which gets the data from the API and displays it on the page, and creates the history of previous searched cities.
